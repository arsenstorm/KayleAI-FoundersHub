### Provide a description of your startup or project.*



KayleAI is an exceptional open-source service that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to safeguard children from harmful online messages. The platform offers developers an API that rapidly and precisely determines the safety of any message delivered to a child, ensuring that kids can safely communicate and interact online.

In the initial phase of its technology, KayleAI incorporates OpenAI's GPT-3 Moderation Endpoint to scrutinize the content of messages in real time. Whenever an unsafe message is detected, developers are empowered to decide whether or not to display the message to the child. All unsafe messages are recorded in a user-friendly database with metadata that can be conveniently reviewed and copied for appropriate action against the user who sent the message.

KayleAI is ideally suited for developers who create apps or services that cater to children. By integrating KayleAI into their services, developers can rest assured that children will be protected from harmful messages and that the online environment will be a safer space. Moreover, KayleAI's employment of advanced AI technology sets it apart from the competition, and it has the potential to be a market leader in online child safety.

KayleAI's focus on child safety resonates with Microsoft's commitment to creating a safer online environment for all users. By joining the Microsoft for Startups program, I aim to harness Microsoft's resources and expertise to expand KayleAI's reach and impact, thus offering more children a safer online experience.
